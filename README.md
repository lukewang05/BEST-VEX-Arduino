# BEST-VEX-Arduino

This code is part of a project completed in my Independent Study: Mentorship class under the mentorship of Mr. Leslie J. Quiocho.

Both programs are modeled after the BEST/VEX default code and enable the functionalities of the standard robotics setup. 
These include:
- Wireless connection between a controller and the robot
- "Arcade mode" driving and steering for two large motors
- Moving of one small motor and one servo

The code and robot are designed to be customizable assuming that the required structures and equipment are present.
